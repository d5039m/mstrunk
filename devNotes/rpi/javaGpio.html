Make sure we're starting with a fresh install of Raspian that has is fully updated by running:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade


First we need to install a jdk as this project uses java!

> sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk

run java -version to check that everything installed ok
Example project uses teh following jars (which are also stored in the libs folder here)

> wget https://github.com/downloads/savagehomeautomation/raspi-sspc/raspi-sspc-1.0.0.jar
> wget https://github.com/downloads/Pi4J/pi4j/pi4j-core-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT.jar

Run the following command to see if it works
> sudo java -classpath classes:./'*' SSPC
